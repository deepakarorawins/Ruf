HOW DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL DATA?</p>
<p>In order for us to provide our products and services to you, we share your personal data with our trusted third party service providers or our group
companies, as detailed below. Whenever we share your personal data, we put safeguards in place which require these other organisations to keep your data safe and to ensure that they do not use your personal data for their own marketing purposes
unless you have given us your consent to do so. We will never sell your personal data to a third party. </p>
<p><u>To fulfil orders for products and services:</u></p>
<p>We work with a number of trusted service providers who carry out services on our behalf. When you purchase products and services from us, the services
provided by these service providers includes website and database hosting and delivery. It is in our legitimate interests as a business to work with these service providers since we may not have the capabilities to provide these services
ourselves. In each case, we will ensure that the service provider is only allowed to use your personal data in order to provide the services to us and for no other purpose.&nbsp; </p>
<p><u>Other professional services:</u></p>
<p>We may need to disclose your personal data to our insurers where we believe that it is required under our contractual relationship with our insurance
provider to do so. </p>
<p>We work with carefully selected third parties, such as our customer database hosting provider, marketing agencies and advertising partners who assist
us in providing you with a positive customer experience.</p>
<p><u>To prevent and detect crime or otherwise comply with laws:</u></p>
<p>There may be scenarios where we are subject to a legal obligation to share or disclose your personal data, such as with law enforcement agencies or
public authorities in order to prevent or detect crime or fulfil a legal requirement. </p>
<p><u>International group data processing and group structure:</u></p>
<p>Our group shares various operations and business processes.&nbsp; We may share your personal data with any member of our group to fulfil our
contracted obligations to you, or because it is in our legitimate interests to do so. For example, if you use our services in Europe, your data will be processed by Techtronic Industries ELC GmbH, our group company who host our services in
Europe on our behalf. </p>
<p>Similarly, whilst we are based in the USA, we may share your data with a group company of ours local to you in your territory in order to make sure
that we only send you marketing about our products and services that are available in your local territory.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We may also share your personal data if the make-up of our group changes in the future, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>We may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business, or our assets. Or we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them.</li>
<li>During any such process, we may share your data with other parties. We will only do this if they agree to keep your data safe and private.</li>
<li>If a change to our group happens, then other parties may use your data in the same way as set out in this notice.</li>
</ul>
<p>6&nbsp;
COOKIES</p>

website and allows us to improve our site. Our website also uses Google Analytics to evaluate how you use our website and provide further services related to website and internet usage.</p>

<p>7&nbsp;
SECURITY</p>
<p>We take the security of your personal data very seriously.&nbsp; We have implemented various strategies, controls, policies and measures to keep your
data secure and keep these measures under close review. We use a series of administrative, logical, physical and managerial measures to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and unauthorized access, use, and modification.</p>
<p>8&nbsp;
TRANSFER OF YOUR DATA OUTSIDE OF EUROPE</p>
<p>We will transfer your personal data outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) in order to process your personal data. We are based in the USA and,
although we have European data centres, all of your data may be processed by us in the USA. </p>
<p>We may also need to transfer your personal data outside the EEA where we work with a supplier or third party who processes some of its personal data
outside of the EEA. </p>
<p>These countries (including the USA) may not have the same data protection laws as the UK and the EEA and so your personal data may not be subject to
the same protections. However, in such cases, we will make sure that any transfer of your personal data to countries outside of the EEA is subject to appropriate safeguards as if it were being processed inside of the EEA and under the guiding
principles set out in this privacy notice. </p>
<p>If you would like further information please contact us on the contact details set out at the top of this privacy policy
https://www.milwaukeetool.eu/footer/privacy-policy.</p>
<p>9&nbsp;
HOW LONG WILL WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL DATA</p>
<p>In broad terms, we will only retain your personal data for as long as is necessary for the purposes described in this privacy notice.&nbsp; This means
that the retention periods will vary according to the type of the data and the reason that we have the data in the first place. </p>
<p>We have a retention policy in place which we keep under review taking into account our reasons for processing your personal data and the legal basis
for doing so.</p>
<p>You can deleted your account at any time by contacting our Data Information Manager at either address listed in Section 1 above. </p>
<p>10&nbsp;
YOUR RIGHTS &nbsp;</p>
<p>Applicable data protection laws grant you a number of rights in relation to your personal data. You have the right:</p>
<ul>
<li>to ask us not to use your personal
data for direct marketing purposes;</li>
<li>to ask to see what personal data
we hold about you and to find out about the way that we process the data (and in some circumstances, you can ask us to provide a copy to a third party); </li>
<li>to ask us to correct or update any
personal data which is inaccurate; </li>
<li>to ask for personal data to be
deleted in some (but not all) circumstances where there is no good reason for us to continue to use it;</li>
<li>to ask us to temporarily stop
using your data if you don't believe that we have a right to use it, or to stop us from using your personal data where there is no good reason for us to continue to use it; and</li>
<li>not to be subject to decisions
made solely on the basis of 'automated processing' (i.e. the right not to be subject to decisions made solely by algorithms or computers without input from a human) in certain circumstances.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like to contact us in relation to any of your rights, please contact us at the contact details set out at the top of this privacy policy
https://www.milwaukeetool.eu/footer/privacy-policy.</p>
<p>You also have the right to complain about our use of your personal data.&nbsp; You can contact your local Data Protection Supervisory Authority (a
